# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course | Project 5 | Fron-End Web Development

This is my repository for Udacity's  project#5 using Udacity starter code (forked from udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

## Project Overview

A static webpage converted to a mobile-ready web application responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use, starting the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view). Please review for detailed project requirements. The rubric should be a resource you refer to periodically to make sure your project meets specifications.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

## Steps to complete the project
Fork and clone the starter repository. The code in this repository will serve as your baseline to begin development.
From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
- Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
- Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000
- Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000
